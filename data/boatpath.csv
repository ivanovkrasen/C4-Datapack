#
# Speed1 : Speed of the boat
# Speed2 : rotation speed of the boat
# time   : -  > 0:  if the boat has reached the point before the time is spent, the boat wait !
#                   else if the time is spent and the boat has not reached the point, server will pass to the next point
#          -  < 0:  lets server calculate when the boat reachs the point (/!\ don't use time < 0 when you do a rotation with the boat.)
