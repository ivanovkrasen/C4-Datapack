High Prefect Clogg:
<br>
Basically, to earn the qualifications to become an Orc Marauder, your level must be at least 20, and you must pass the Test of the Orc Marauder.
<br>
To take the Test of the Orc Marauder, go to 
<font color="LEVEL">
Prefect Karukia of the Orc village
</font>
. He will tell you everything you need to know. If you pass the test and come back, I will change your profession. To get to the Orc village, first go to Gludio, then use a Gatekeeper.
