Elven Rangers

 are the sentries of the forest, and have protected the Elven home from invaders for thousands of years. Since their footsteps are lighter than feathers, they can walk and run over the fallen leaves without making any noise as they approach their opponents.

The most talented Elven Rangers are selected as 
<font color="LEVEL">
Stealth Sentinels,

 the Ranger elite. Others among the Elven Rangers are selected as

 and train in the utmost mastery of archery.
