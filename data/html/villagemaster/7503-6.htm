Warehouse Chief Rikadio:
<br>
To qualify to become a Raider, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Raider.
<br>
Ask 
<font color="LEVEL">
Collector Pippi of the Dwarven village
</font>
 about the Test of the Raider. She will tell you everything you need to know about the test, in detail. After you have passed the test, come to me. Then I will change your profession to a Raider.
<br>
Use a Gatekeeper to get to the Dwarven village.
