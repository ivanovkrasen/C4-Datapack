A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. I'm afraid you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. If you are an Elven Fighter, you can change profession to become an 
<font color="LEVEL">
Elven Knight
</font>
 or an 
<font color="LEVEL">
Elven Ranger
</font>
. Which profession do you want to learn about?
