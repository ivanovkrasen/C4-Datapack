Head Blacksmith Ferris:
<br>
There used to be a lot of work for us blacksmiths to do here in Aden Castle Town. But all I can say is that Elmore is showing itself as an enemy country yet again nearby. Thanks to that, the Black Anvil Guild will have some fun...
<br>
I was wondering if things would slow down after that terrible war was over but it looks like it will be difficult to relax for the time being...
