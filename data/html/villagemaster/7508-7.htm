High Prefect Clogg:
<br>
Basically, to become a Paagrio Monk, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Paagrio Monk.
<br>
To take the Test of the Paagrio Monk, seek the Orc named 
<font color="LEVEL">
Gantaki Zu Urutu of the Orc village
</font>
. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession. Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.
