<html><head><body>How to Fish:<br><br>
You can sell your fish or cut it apart. You can use its parts to make other objects, or exchange it for a mark of fishery at the Fishermen's Guild. You can also sell the fish in the shops after cutting it up.<br>
You must use caution then cutting up fish. You might find recipes or other useful things, or nothing at all.<br>
Bring us many marks of fishery, and we'll gladly accept you into our guild and teach you a few of our secret techniques! You must carefully consider what to do with your catch.<br>
Keep an eye out for any recipes you might find while fishing. They are quite valuable!<br><br>
