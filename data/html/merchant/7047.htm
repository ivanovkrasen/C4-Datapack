Wharf Manager Firon:
<br>
You came here to catch a boat? These days there are only liners that go to Gludin, but in the olden days when we traded with Gracia, this harbor was always bustling with ships bringing in new goods... War, hah, what is it good for? I miss the vigor and color of the old harbor... I wonder what the people there are doing now...
<br>
Oh... I m rambling again. Do you want a boat ticket?
