Wharf Manager Clancy:
<br>
You came here to catch a boat? These days there are only liners that go to Talking Island, but in the olden days when we traded with Gracia, this harbor was always bustling with boats bringing in new wares... What is war anyway? I miss the passion and vigor of the old harbor...
<br>
Do you want a ticket for transport?
