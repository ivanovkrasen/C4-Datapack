Hmm, there was talk of opening up the border with Elmore.  I don t know whether the negotiations broke down among high level people somewhere.  But now, the border is even more tightly sealed than before&

Actually, my younger brother has gone to Elmore to start a business&  I am afraid that I may never get to see him again.
